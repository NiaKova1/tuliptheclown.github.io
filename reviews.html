  <p>My daughter is six years old. And for the first time we decided to ask an animator for help. Ksenia was chosen because she spoke Russian, and all the girls at the party were Russian. Ksenia took into account all my wishes. As a mother, I also wanted to partially participate in games with children. And everything worked out. It was a lot of fun!!! And my eldest daughter even wrote a story in her diary the next day after the holiday about how much fun they had that day. Thank you very much Ksenia! You're really great! Most of all, children remember magic tricks, they still cannot understand how it all happened 🙂 Highly recommend:)</p>

  <p>Dear Kseniya, Thank you very much for a wonderful time. Children absolutely loved it and I must admit parents as well! We were captivated by the charming fairy and the mime from the first minute and it was really sad to let you go at the end :-). Looking forward to seeing you again. Best, Irina</p>

All the guests were delighted and even adults 🙂 Many different contests, magic tricks, balloons and much more! Wonderful Xenia had a great holiday!
